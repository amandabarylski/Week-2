/* Instructions: Style the website you made last week using CSS with the following requirements:

    Use only external CSS file (no internal or inline styling)
    Every element must be styled.
    Create style rules using class, id, and element selectors.

Before beginning the styling process, I adjusted some of the tags in the HTML.
Specifically, I added a main element to each page, removed inline styling, and made the sections with links nav instead.
I also added class and id tags to certain paragraph elements and all images to make it easier to select them individually.
